# Botpack + Letta (Merged)

This spec was merged into the main Botpack architecture spec to avoid redundant docs.

See:

- `worklanes/smarty-kit/projects/botpack/SPEC.md` section `## 17) Letta integration (v1)`

Rationale:

- Botpack should have a single canonical spec.
- Letta support is a first-class Botpack feature, not a separate project.
